## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m a **QA Engineer at Auditorium**, where I work on ensuring product quality through **manual testing, test case design, and automated testing** for production systems used by real users.

Alongside QA, I have hands-on experience with the **MERN stack** and have delivered a **client-based eCommerce application**, which helps me test applications with a strong developer mindset.

I’m also currently enrolled in the **10 Academy AI Mastery Program (Week 6/12)**, where I work on weekly, hands-on projects focused on **data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving**, all documented here on GitHub.

I enjoy building, testing, and improving systems — from early MVPs to scalable applications.
